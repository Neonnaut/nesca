# NeSCA-pro

Version 0.0.1

This is a word generator designed to be a successor to the Williams' [Lexifer][1] and to [Awkwords][2]. It is built using TypeScript and builds using Vite as a browser app with a complete interface. As the name implies, NeSCA, is the 'pro' version of the partial NeSCA, NeSCA-lite.

NeSCA-pro randomly generates vocabulary from a given definition of graphemes, frequencies and word patterns. You can use it to make words for a constructed language, to get an original nickname or password, or just for fun.

## Development

To build use `npm run build`. For live testing use `npm run dev`.
