Thoughts....

- HTML entities, good, keep them in `{}`

- Promises

- segments have a... bug? where if I say `$S = cas an` it resolves as two wordshapes instead of abbreviation of a single wordshape ... ugh

- I should finish all wordgen things, then move on to Nasc, then go back here to improve transforms

- Null symbol as alternative to caret?

- Do I keep graphemes escaped going past into the transforms?
If so, this would mean [ > @, would not work on a word \[ada

- need to merge zero words with duplicates removed

- need to time out regardless of force words

- In tests do find loops

- Troubleshooting

TRANSFORMS

I can prob use `&` as seperator again... perhaps it could replace ditto mark!!

Anythings-mark should be ampersand.
